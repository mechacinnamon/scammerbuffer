## The Many Reasons I Lost Money In A Scam

It's not because of scammers alone that i lost my money. I lost almost all of my life savings because of many reasons, but the i think that the biggest of them was discovering dropshipping (<b>maybe</b>, read along to understand why). Anyways i will tell them first and then explain them here, i think i can clearly say they are:

1. <b>Discovering dropshipping</b>.
2. <b>Receiving a good amount of money</b> in one time.
3. <b>Heartbreak</b>. because of a girl i met that was very nice with me and also a bit shy so i thought she liked me but then after some months she told me about some boyfriend, just casually like that, a random day. And it was not a random boyfriend...
4. <b>Loneliness</b>, i have very few friends and i am very introverted but i think i am upgrading my life in this field currently, i didn't have anyone to whom i could speak to or get help or advice so i was at the mercy of heartless scammers.
5. I was very <b>emotional</b> and believed i could do everything because i wasn't like many others that just thought of what beer to drink saturday etc.

Maybe there are more reasons that are unknown to me yet but i could clearly identify these ones at least.

Look i wanted easy money and fast, i think that's what everyone subconsciously wants, but i wanted it so badly that i searched every possible fast way. So i did what every <b>determined</b> person of our times does, search on the internet what could you do to achieve this other than working a full job and spending all your life's <b>time</b> there, (also having a limited amount of money possible to make). I discovered (mostly on YouTube) some methods to make "easy" money online (affiliate marketing, dropshipping and so on, if you know you know) so i listed them and i begin trying every one of them, but something went terribly wrong.

I will tell you the truth, very few people can tell the truth. I am not an expert writer so please still try to read my story :) i will try to make a good article, but keep in mind that i am writing this when in reality the scam happened like <b>6 months ago</b>, this is because i didn't know what to do back then but now i wanted justice and my story to be heard, i will fight these scammers and will see if i can do something legally against scammers like blocking their business with an international police or something like this. Currently i just opened this website thanks to my IT background, so i can make this story an ispiration for someone else and also save them from losing money like i did.

### The Heartbreak

First i want to talk about the heartbreak so we can forget about it, and i think maybe it's the biggest of the reasons because it pushed me to become rich so i thought that the girl would like me back or something like that.

It all began when i joined university in 2022. I was in the first academic year so i was very enthusiastic and i studied a lot the first months. in the second month of university i spoke to some boys and girls casually one time, there were many people just by themselves and i was one of them, then there were groups of people who always hang out and there were a total of 120 people in my class. Anyways i don't know why but thankfully i spoke that day just, spontaneously, if i hadn't, probably I wouldn't have done it in a year or up until a group project came up and i would have been very lonely because I was very shy.

But then later in that second month i saw this girl and she was beautiful to say the least, she also seemed a bit shy like me. and she was friends with the people i met so i thought why don't i go and try to speak to her? One day i was with the people and her at the place where all the students eat, and she also was with us at our table. I felt a bit like an impostor because they all seem to know each other better when you are very lonely i hope someone can understand that. So i was the least known there, but then we went to class and there was a chance to speak to that girl, so i did. I spoke to her when she was sitting near me and i asked her something i don't want to enter the details here but just know that we had a <b>legendary-like</b> talk and i was so f**g proud of myself for doing that and she also wanted to know my name while i didn't even think of that! That's a signal of attraction right?

So i then i was so happy because of speaking with this girl you can't imagine how happy i was. Because i never had a girlfriend and i was 21 at the time. Now i don't have one either but i am trying to talk to some girl here but it's really difficult as a guy too get into a relationship and even just friendships because girls have just more perceived value and they also have a default grade of being better than average guys, that's one of my theories, i mean girls are just better than average guys in most of things but they are inferior to the top percent real men who get better every day in many things in life.

So i also begin studying like some signals if girls liked me and things like that, i was in class and i noticed something about girls who where looking too much at some guys and then i thought okay what is that guy doing etc. so i learned some body language and i read many articles online also. So i thought i had seen it all and i was an expert. Then i thought that the girl liked me because of some signals like these.

But i was so wrong...

The girl i liked and talked to that made me happy, was already in a relationship unfortunately... i quickly discovered that i wasn't the main character in a very brutal and hard way. But guess what? Then i was so sad that i couldn't sleep at night and i felt more lonely than ever before in my life (imagine this, from most happy to most sad, just in the matter of a split second when the girl told me about her boyfriend in class, randomly, like she wasn't that shy anymore) so naturally, i begin to lose more sleep, i couldn't sleep for months i was thinking about her at night and crying when i went to sleep with my no meaning life. I also saw her boyfriend, who was an old friend of my best friend met in university. He was a tall man (much taller than me) he looks exactly like [Keanu Reeves](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=98c6703634b67c62&sxsrf=AHTn8zq31oKqMEXS7wX6pKqVRDhCd17Oyg:1744917056913&q=keanu+reeves&source=lnms&fbs=ABzOT_CJHzLz2g9qLwS3rPIwRoY84oX4_Z-Cl9eu6FL5-ogFnsQxdjxawdopnpYxHtW9NBhSfkE4SBWP4ttZNTAwcP93rRIqdm8ItJWAJ92VK5pD93MWynbFrW7AtE75e-I-JNn4eFL00mhFAt1lLy6TJz5v3bKkICoXZf7Sf-B6Kr5ZkvSE-ofXfr0gbdtT2lloJxI-CVk5drL8JtZf75-0bF00pzlxig&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiE2tvK4t-MAxWf9QIHHfO4FX4Q0pQJegQIFBAB&biw=1536&bih=702&dpr=1.25#vhid=2pK1OlLWXxdjaM&vssid=_WlIBaIvvPMuBi-gPjtWd0Ak_51) with long black hair. Now i hate Keanu Reeves and i am not even joking.

I was crying every night and slept 3 hours every night for 1 year and i was sad, every day, one time i also cried on the bus on my way home to my parents and i didn't tell nobody about it for a while. Then my parents started noticing my sadness, i used to watch many motivational content online on self improvement, every one of them said not too say nothing to anyone, but i was so lonely and i saw the girls having an easier life with dating etc. and i was so sad i couldn't do anything

So in the end i told my parents about the situation with the girl and nothing much changed except they sent me to counseling. After that some time passed, from the last time i spoke to that girl (ending of first year) up until the beginning of the third year nothing much changed and i was just suffering but then after the first half of that year i also ended my studies for a while and maybe i will finish it i don't really know at the moment, what i know is that i am at the end of the third year at the moment in which i write this and i feel great now, it's just that i still have a wound but i can sleep well fortunately.

Anyways the scam happened at the beginning of this third year of university (September-October 2024). Now we can talk about it in detail.

### The Other Reasons

The other reasons were also loneliness and i was so lonely i remember i would go for a walk in a park near my university all alone and constantly sad, seeing people walking by and i remember listening to music like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL8DVHuWI7Y) which is not so good because i learnt from some video i saw on Youtube and i can't remember that music makes you more emotional so if i listened to all that music i would link this kind of music to my emotion which was sadness and i would feel sad whenever listening to this music so i would be constantly sad even when i wasn't that sad because of music. 

Like i said the other reasons are that i discovered dropshipping, but another important reason is that i received a little more than $4000 in one day, it was from academics, i don't want to discuss it but i received this money so i thought i was at a good sum of money i built having also another little amount for myself.

So i thought why not invest them into a "business" and i remembered dropshipping.

Then i watched many videos and learned new things and then i also subscribed to some discord servers on dropshipping and it was here that the downfall began.

Because in those servers i would find scammers!

## How The Scam Happens

I want to discuss briefly how the scam takes place and then i will go into detail.

So the scammers i dealt with are just <b>dropshipping scammers</b> in this article but i will discuss other scammers to fight scamming on this website. I recently talked with some girls on instagram and i think it's another type of scam i will discuss in another article because it affects pretty much boys and i am safe maybe just because i saw a certain video on Youtube from someone who fell to this scam otherwise i think i would've fell for another scam!

The scammers are pretty much very prone to talking to you first in the discord servers, and i also have a theory that they are all kind of stupid in a way. Every scammers it's like a bit stupid because they do some actions that reveal them it's just that if you are helpless, alone, fragile and emotional like i was, you can still fall for some scams!

What i mean as you will see is that they also change usernames or things like these, or some just contact you very often and it's a thing that maybe nobody does easily, i mean you could say these servers of dropshipping are full of special people who could text you enthusiastically for a genuine talk but if you have been scammed at least one time in your life and you clearly absorb it into you, you can't be scammed another time i think.

Now i am the stupidest person you ever met you would say after reading this article because i lost $3000, not all of it in one payment but in multiple payments and maybe with 4 different scammers i don't even remember! So i was kind of dumb to repeat the same errors! But i just wanted help and i was in a fragile state... I had in fact, a little alarm or something in my brain telling me that something was not quite right, but i continued paying the scammers for some reason...So the scammers i dealt with are just <b>dropshipping scammers</b> in this article but i will discuss other scammers and i recently talked with some girls on instagram and i think it's another type of scam i will discuss in my second article because it affects pretty much boys and i am safe maybe just because i saw a certain video on Youtube from someone who fell to this scam otherwise i think i would've fell for another scam!

### Analysis Of Dropshipping Scammers And Their Ways Of Doing

While i was making the first payments, the first scammer which is the biggest one, made me pay $60 then maybe he saw i was comfortable with that and he said that he needed it for the work, then he asked me another $100 then $200 and so on and i arrived at a point of maybe $1800 but because of a <b>fortunate event</b> i could get back some money. So the first scammer only took like $1000 i think. He just left me some useless shopify store!

Then he asked me to start creating a shopify store etc.

![](https://files.catbox.moe/uuy1b4.png)

He wasn't here for a talk or some fun we could say, he was in <b>business</b>.

![](https://files.catbox.moe/ahgffn.png)

![](https://files.catbox.moe/ax3ffe.png)

I asked if i could do the naming what are our roles etc. (so as you can see i was very keen on and serious and he just didn't give a damn) because i thought that we would work on it together or that it would be a serious thing something like that.

On the other hand he was... very calm, like there was nothing to worry about, but i understand it now because he was just after my money, then when he gets it he would just troll me or leave so i understand now why it wasn't worried like i was, because you see i understood that:

> a business is like a child and whoever starts it is his parent but other people can't or don't want to take care of your child, so the only one concerned with your child is you.

## MMM

So anyways i discovered dropshipping and then i tried to learn it (with YouTube free courses, not the best thing i know, at least with the topic of dropshipping). That's when i discovered [Jordan Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@JordanBown), he is a youtuber that talks about dropshipping and ecommerce. So you may think that he became rich with dropshipping, but i don't think so. You see, i binge watched many of his videos and obviously discovered his famous [18 hours free dropshipping course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqGNDT_utao). That's when things clicked, so i told myself that if i watched that course, i could get into dropshipping, then i did and... it was a disaster.
